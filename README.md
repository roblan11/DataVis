# Pokémon Similarity Visualization

This visualisation aims to reveal which Pokémon are the most alike according to several criterias, in a fun and interactive way so that all Pokémon lovers willing to improve their knowledge and strategies could use it, or simply let them discover possible relationships between Pokémon and generations. What makes this visualization special, is that it takes into account properties which are unused for battle strategies, such as classification, weight or height.
